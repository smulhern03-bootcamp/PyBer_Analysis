# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
Provide new analysis of Pyber data on Urban, Suburban and Rural city data.  Break down the provided Pyber data to understand total drives, riders, fares and average fare per rider and average fare per driver.  After the data has been broken down, an analysis will proivided and three recommendations based upon the analysis.

## Results
The following images are taken from the Pyber data.  The first is a summary of all the data compiled and the line chart is a graph of fares accumlated by city type between 1 JAN 2019 and 30 APR 2019.

The Pyber data is not surprising.  Urban cities, with their larger populations, had the highest amounts in total rides, drivers and fares.  However, the average fare per ride and driver are the least of the three city types.  This is not surprising as more rides and more drivers decreases the overall impact of an individual ride.  The inverse situation occurs for suburban and rural cities - less rides, drivers and fares with rural having the least and increased average fare per ride and drivers, with rural cities having the highest averages.  Again, this is not surprising as less drivers and less rides would result in an increased impact per ride.

The above chart shows fares collect by city type each week between 1 JAN and 30 APR 2019.  As already discussed, the urban fares were significantly higher than the suburban or rurals.  The highest rural fares was less than a third of the lowest urban fare.
## Summary
Based upon the data and analysis the following three recommendations are made:

1.  Increase the number of drivers in Urban cities.  As Urban cities are the signficant money-makers, increasing the amount of drivers could, potentially, allow more rides to be provided and more money to be generated.  Averages would continue to decrease but overall fares collected would increase.
2.  Determine why the rural cities have such low numbers.  Is it due to small population or spread out residences?  Do the rural cities have more access to parking so patrons do not find Pyber useful?
3.  Build up suburban clientele.  Run specials on weekends to specific address blocks - entertainment districts, attractions, theme parks, etc... Suburban cities likely have the access to cars but still have the problem of limited parking in entertain locations.

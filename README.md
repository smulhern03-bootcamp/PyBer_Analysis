# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


## Results
The following images are taken from the Pyber data.  The first is a summary of all the data compiled and the line chart is a graph of fares accumlated by city type between 1 JAN 2019 and 30 APR 2019.

The Pyber data is not surprising.  Urban cities, with their larger populations, had the highest amounts in total rides, drivers and fares.  However, the average fare per ride and driver are the least of the three city types.  This is not surprising as more rides and more drivers decreases the overall impact of an individual ride.  The inverse situation occurs for suburban and rural cities - less rides, drivers and fares with rural having the least and increased average fare per ride and drivers, with rural cities having the highest averages.  Again, this is not surprising as less drivers and less rides would result in an increased impact per ride.

The above chart shows fares collect by city type each week between 1 JAN and 30 APR 2019.  As already discussed, the urban fares were significantly higher than the suburban or rurals.  The highest rural fares was less than a third of the lowers urban fare.
## Summary

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
